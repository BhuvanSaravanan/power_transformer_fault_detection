## Abstract
Accurate diagnosis of power transformer faults is
essential for ensuring the stability and safety of electrical
power systems. This research presents a comparative analysis
of conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms and deep
learning (DL) algorithms for fault classification of power
transformer. Leveraging the condition monitored dataset which
span for 10 months, various gas concentration features were
normalized and used to train five ML classifiers—Support
Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ran-
dom Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Network
(ANN) —as well as three DL models, including Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), One-
Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), and
TabNet. Experimental results demonstrate both conventional
machine learning (ML) algorithms and deep learning (DL)
algorithms performed at par: the highest accuracy among ML
models was achieved by RF at 86.82%, whereas DL model
1D-CNN emerged very close at 86.30%.
